## ‚úÖ Contribution Guidelines

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where applicable
- Add references to papers or resources
- Follow the existing markdown structure
- Ensure proper formatting and readability

### Code

- Follow Python best practices (PEP 8)
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Include comments for complex logic
- Ensure code is well-tested

### Notebooks

- Use clear markdown cells to explain concepts
- Include visualizations where helpful

## üìù Style Guide

### Markdown

- Use `#` for main titles, `##` for sections, `###` for subsections
- Use code blocks with language specification: \```python
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use **bold** for emphasis, *italics* for slight emphasis
- Include blank lines between sections

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to all public functions

Example:
```python
def calculate_attention_scores(query: torch.Tensor, key: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Calculate attention scores between query and key vectors.
    
    Args:
        query: Query tensor of shape (batch_size, seq_len, d_model)
        key: Key tensor of shape (batch_size, seq_len, d_model)
    
    Returns:
        Attention scores of shape (batch_size, seq_len, seq_len)
    """
    d_k = query.size(-1)
    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d_k)
    return scores
```

## üí¨ Commit Message Guidelines
