### Content Structure

#### 1. Introduction (Analogy-driven)
**Analogy:** "Your Brain vs Artificial Neural Networks"
- Human brain has ~86 billion neurons
- Each neuron receives signals, processes them, sends output
- Artificial neural networks mimic this with math

**Analogy:** "Neural Network as a Team of Specialists"

- Before/after training comparison
- Simple decision boundary visualization

### Common Pitfalls to Address
- "It's just like a brain!" - Clarify it's simplified

## 📚 Part 2: Single Neuron - The Building Block

**File:** `00-neural-networks/fundamentals/02-single-neuron.ipynb`

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what a single neuron does mathematically
- Implement a neuron from scratch in NumPy
- Grasp the concept of weights and bias
- See how a neuron makes a simple decision

### Content Structure

#### 1. The Neuron Analogy
**Analogy:** "A Neuron as a Voter"
- Gets multiple inputs (opinions from friends)
- Each input has different importance (trust level = weight)
- Adds them up, plus personal bias
- Makes a decision (output)

**Analogy:** "A Weighted Average Calculator"
- Like calculating your grade with different weights
- Homework: 20%, Midterm: 30%, Final: 50%
- Inputs × weights + bias = output

#### 2. Mathematical Foundation (Gentle)
- Formula: `output = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + bias`
- This is just a weighted sum!
- Visualize as a line in 2D (for 2 inputs)

#### 3. Step-by-Step Implementation

**Step 1:** Single input, single weight
```python
def simple_neuron(input_value, weight, bias):
    """
    The simplest neuron: one input, one weight
    
    Think of it like: 
    - input_value: how much you studied (hours)
    - weight: how much studying matters (effectiveness)
    - bias: your baseline knowledge
    """
    return input_value * weight + bias
```

**Step 2:** Multiple inputs
```python
def neuron(inputs, weights, bias):
    """
    A neuron with multiple inputs
    
    inputs: list of numbers [x1, x2, x3, ...]
    weights: how important each input is [w1, w2, w3, ...]
    bias: baseline adjustment
    """
    output = bias
    for x, w in zip(inputs, weights):
        output += x * w
    return output
```

**Step 3:** Vectorized version
```python
import numpy as np

def neuron_vectorized(inputs, weights, bias):
    """Same as above but using numpy's dot product"""
    return np.dot(inputs, weights) + bias
```

#### 4. Interactive Examples

**Example 1:** Pass/Fail Predictor
- Input 1: Hours studied
- Input 2: Previous test score
- Manually set weights [0.3, 0.7]
- Bias = -50
- Calculate output for different students

**Example 2:** Visualizing Decision Boundary
- 2 inputs (x, y coordinates)
- Show the line the neuron creates
- Points above line = one class, below = another

### Code Examples
- Complete implementations of all neuron versions
- Interactive widget to adjust weights and see changes
- Visualization of decision boundary

### Visualizations Needed
- Neuron diagram with inputs, weights, sum, output
- 2D plot showing decision boundary
- Weight adjustment interactive tool

### Math Explanations
- **Dot Product:** "Like measuring how much two arrows point in same direction"
- **Linear Combination:** "Mixing ingredients with different amounts"
- Explain why it's called "linear" (makes a straight line)

### Common Pitfalls
- "Why do we need bias?" - Show examples where it shifts the line
- "What if all weights are same?" - Demonstrate with example
- "Can one neuron solve any problem?" - Introduce limitations (XOR problem preview)

---

## 📚 Part 3: Activation Functions

**File:** `00-neural-networks/fundamentals/03-activation-functions.ipynb`

### Learning Objectives
- Understand why we need non-linearity
- Learn common activation functions
- Implement each activation from scratch
- Know when to use which activation

### Content Structure

#### 1. Why Activation Functions?

**Problem Setup:** The Linear Limitation
- Show that stacking linear functions = another linear function
- Analogy: "Layers of straight lines still make straight lines"
- Need something to add "curves" to our decisions

**Analogy:** "Activation as a Filter"
- Like a light switch - not just dimmer
- ReLU = "pass positive signals only"
- Sigmoid = "squash everything between 0 and 1"

#### 2. Common Activation Functions

**Step Function (Historical)**
```python
def step_function(x):
    """Original idea: fire or don't fire"""
    return 1 if x >= 0 else 0
```
- Problem: Not differentiable (can't learn from it)

**Sigmoid (Classic)**
```python
def sigmoid(x):
    """Squashes everything to range (0, 1)"""
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
```
- **Analogy:** "A smooth light dimmer"
- Use case: Output probabilities
- Drawback: Vanishing gradients (explain gently)

**Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**
```python
def tanh(x):
    """Like sigmoid but centered at 0, range (-1, 1)"""
    return np.tanh(x)
```
- Better than sigmoid for hidden layers
- **Analogy:** "Balanced scale from -1 to 1"

**ReLU (The Modern Standard)**
```python
def relu(x):
    """Keep positive, kill negative"""
    return max(0, x)
```
- **Analogy:** "A one-way valve for water"
- Fast to compute
- Helps with vanishing gradient
- Most commonly used today

**Leaky ReLU**
```python
def leaky_relu(x, alpha=0.01):
    """Like ReLU but lets small negative values through"""
    return max(alpha * x, x)
```
- Fixes "dying ReLU" problem

#### 3. Interactive Visualizations
- Plot each function
- Show derivatives (gentle introduction)
- Interactive comparison tool

#### 4. Applying Activations to Neurons
```python
def neuron_with_activation(inputs, weights, bias, activation='relu'):
    """Complete neuron with activation function"""
    z = np.dot(inputs, weights) + bias  # Linear combination
    if activation == 'relu':
        return relu(z)
    elif activation == 'sigmoid':
        return sigmoid(z)
    # ... etc
```

### Code Examples
- Implementation of all major activation functions
- Side-by-side comparisons
- Apply to our previous neuron examples

### Visualizations Needed
- Line plots of each activation function
- Derivative plots (with simple explanation)
- Interactive slider to see activation on different inputs
- Decision boundary comparison (linear vs with activation)

### Math Explanations
- **Derivative:** "How fast something is changing" (slope of curve)
- **Vanishing Gradient:** "Signal gets weaker in deep networks"
- Why ReLU helps: derivative is either 0 or 1 (simple!)

### Common Pitfalls
- "When to use which?" - Provide decision tree
- "Can I use multiple activations?" - Yes! Different per layer
- "Why not just use step function?" - Show learning issue

---

## 📚 Part 4: Multiple Neurons - Building Layers

**File:** `00-neural-networks/fundamentals/04-neural-network-layer.ipynb`

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what a layer of neurons is
- Implement a layer with multiple neurons
- Use matrix operations for efficiency
- Visualize how layers transform data

### Content Structure

#### 1. From One Neuron to Many

**Analogy:** "Committee of Experts"
- One neuron = one specialist
- Layer = committee with different perspectives
- Each neuron learns different features

**Analogy:** "Factory Assembly Line"
- Each neuron processes inputs differently
- All neurons work in parallel
- Outputs go to next layer

#### 2. Manual Implementation

**Step 1:** Two neurons explicitly
```python
def two_neurons(inputs, weights1, bias1, weights2, bias2):
    """Two separate neurons"""
    output1 = np.dot(inputs, weights1) + bias1
    output2 = np.dot(inputs, weights2) + bias2
    return [output1, output2]
```

**Step 2:** Loop approach
```python
def layer_loop(inputs, weights_list, biases_list):
    """Multiple neurons using loop"""
    outputs = []
    for weights, bias in zip(weights_list, biases_list):
        output = np.dot(inputs, weights) + bias
        outputs.append(output)
    return outputs
```

#### 3. Matrix Math Introduction (Gentle)

**Concept:** "Processing Multiple Things at Once"
- Instead of one neuron at a time, do all together
- Weights become a matrix (table of numbers)
- One operation instead of many

**Visual Explanation:**
```
Inputs: [x1, x2, x3]

Weight Matrix:
    x1   x2   x3
n1 [w11  w12  w13]
n2 [w21  w22  w23]
n3 [w31  w32  w33]

Each row = one neuron's weights
```

#### 4. Vectorized Layer Implementation

```python
class Layer:
    def __init__(self, n_inputs, n_neurons):
        """
        n_inputs: how many numbers coming in
        n_neurons: how many neurons in this layer
        """
        # Random small weights
        self.weights = np.random.randn(n_inputs, n_neurons) * 0.1
        # Biases start at zero
        self.biases = np.zeros(n_neurons)
    
    def forward(self, inputs):
        """
        Process inputs through all neurons at once
        
        inputs: shape (n_inputs,)
        returns: shape (n_neurons,)
        """
        return np.dot(inputs, self.weights) + self.biases
```

#### 5. Layer with Activation

```python
class LayerWithActivation:
    def __init__(self, n_inputs, n_neurons, activation='relu'):
        self.weights = np.random.randn(n_inputs, n_neurons) * 0.1
        self.biases = np.zeros(n_neurons)
        self.activation = activation
    
    def forward(self, inputs):
        # Linear transformation
        z = np.dot(inputs, self.weights) + self.biases
        
        # Apply activation
        if self.activation == 'relu':
            return np.maximum(0, z)
        elif self.activation == 'sigmoid':
            return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))
        # ... etc
```

### Code Examples
- Build layers step by step
- Visualize what each neuron in a layer learns
- Show batch processing (multiple inputs at once)

### Visualizations Needed
- Matrix multiplication visualization
- Layer transformation (input space → output space)
- Weight matrix heatmap
- Each neuron's decision boundary in the layer

### Math Explanations
- **Matrix Multiplication:** "Combining tables of numbers"
- **Broadcasting:** "Adding the same number to all outputs"
- Why shape matters: (inputs, n_inputs) × (n_inputs, n_neurons) = (inputs, n_neurons)

### Common Pitfalls
- "Matrix dimensions must match" - explain with diagrams
- "Random initialization" - why we can't use all zeros
- "How many neurons in a layer?" - Provide guidelines

---

## 📚 Part 5: Forward Propagation - Connecting Layers

**File:** `00-neural-networks/fundamentals/05-forward-propagation.ipynb`

### Learning Objectives
- Connect multiple layers into a network
- Understand data flow through the network
- Implement forward propagation
- Visualize intermediate layer outputs

### Content Structure

#### 1. The Network Architecture

**Analogy:** "Assembly Line Processing"
- Input layer: Raw materials arrive
- Hidden layer 1: First processing step
- Hidden layer 2: Refinement step
- Output layer: Final product

**Analogy:** "Layers of Translation"
- Each layer speaks a different "language"
- Transform input gradually into output

#### 2. Simple Two-Layer Network

```python
class SimpleNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        """
        input_size: number of features
        hidden_size: neurons in hidden layer
        output_size: number of classes/outputs
        """
        self.layer1 = LayerWithActivation(input_size, hidden_size, 'relu')
        self.layer2 = LayerWithActivation(hidden_size, output_size, 'sigmoid')
    
    def forward(self, x):
        """Pass data through the network"""
        # First layer
        hidden = self.layer1.forward(x)
        # Second layer
        output = self.layer2.forward(hidden)
        return output
```

#### 3. Deeper Networks

```python
class DeepNetwork:
    def __init__(self, layer_sizes):
        """
        layer_sizes: list [input_size, hidden1, hidden2, ..., output_size]
        Example: [784, 128, 64, 10] for MNIST
        """
        self.layers = []
        for i in range(len(layer_sizes) - 1):
            layer = LayerWithActivation(
                layer_sizes[i], 
                layer_sizes[i+1],
                activation='relu' if i < len(layer_sizes)-2 else 'sigmoid'
            )
            self.layers.append(layer)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        """Sequential forward pass"""
        activation = x
        for layer in self.layers:
            activation = layer.forward(activation)
        return activation
```

#### 4. Batch Processing

**Why Batch Processing?**
- Process multiple examples at once
- More efficient computation
- Better gradient estimates

```python
def forward_batch(self, X):
    """
    X: shape (batch_size, input_size)
    returns: shape (batch_size, output_size)
    """
    activation = X
    for layer in self.layers:
        activation = layer.forward(activation)
    return activation
```

#### 5. Visualization of Intermediate Outputs

Show what happens at each layer:
- Input: Original data
- Layer 1 output: Extracted features
- Layer 2 output: Higher-level features
- Output: Final predictions

### Code Examples
- Build networks of different depths
- Process single examples
- Process batches
- Visualize activations at each layer

### Visualizations Needed
- Network architecture diagram
- Data flow animation
- Activation heatmaps at each layer
- Dimension changes through network

### Math Explanations
- **Composition of Functions:** f(g(x)) - feeding output to next function
- Shape tracking through layers
- Batch dimensions

### Common Pitfalls
- "Shape mismatches" - careful tracking
- "Why different activations?" - explain output layer needs
- "How many layers?" - Provide guidelines

## 📚 Part 6: Loss Functions - Measuring Error

**File:** `00-neural-networks/fundamentals/06-loss-functions.ipynb`

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what loss functions measure
- Learn common loss functions
- Implement loss calculations
- Choose appropriate loss for different tasks

### Content Structure

#### 1. What is Loss?

**Analogy:** "Measuring Your Mistakes"
- Like grading a test - how many wrong?
- Loss = how far predictions are from truth
- Lower loss = better predictions

**Analogy:** "GPS Navigation Error"
- Predicted location vs actual location
- Different ways to measure distance
- Want to minimize the error

#### 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)

**For Regression Tasks**

```python
def mean_squared_error(predictions, targets):
    """
    How far off are we, on average?
    
    predictions: what network predicted
    targets: actual correct values
    """
    # Difference
    errors = predictions - targets
    # Square them (makes all positive, penalizes big errors more)
    squared_errors = errors ** 2
    # Average
    return np.mean(squared_errors)
```

**Why Square?**
- Makes all errors positive
- Penalizes large errors more
- Smooth derivative (good for learning)

#### 3. Binary Cross-Entropy

**For Binary Classification (Yes/No)**

```python
def binary_cross_entropy(predictions, targets):
    """
    How well do we predict probabilities?
    
    predictions: probability between 0 and 1
    targets: actual class (0 or 1)
    """
    # Clip to avoid log(0)
    predictions = np.clip(predictions, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
    
    # Calculate loss
    return -np.mean(
        targets * np.log(predictions) + 
        (1 - targets) * np.log(1 - predictions)
    )
```

**Intuition:**
- Heavily penalizes confident wrong predictions
- If target=1 but predicted=0.01, big loss!

#### 4. Categorical Cross-Entropy

**For Multi-Class Classification**

```python
def categorical_cross_entropy(predictions, targets):
    """
    Multi-class version
    
    predictions: probability for each class [0.1, 0.7, 0.2]
    targets: one-hot encoded [0, 1, 0]
    """
    predictions = np.clip(predictions, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
    return -np.mean(np.sum(targets * np.log(predictions), axis=1))
```

#### 5. Comparing Losses

Interactive visualization:
- Show different predictions
- Calculate each loss
- See which penalizes what

### Code Examples
- Implement all loss functions
- Calculate on sample data
- Visualize loss landscapes

### Visualizations Needed
- Loss curves for different predictions
- Comparison of MSE vs Cross-Entropy
- 3D loss landscape

### Math Explanations
- **Logarithm:** "Measuring exponential relationships"
- **Why log in cross-entropy?** - Information theory connection (brief)
- **Mean:** Just averaging to get one number

### Common Pitfalls
- "MSE for classification?" - Explain why cross-entropy is better
- "When to use which?" - Decision guide
- "Negative loss?" - Can happen with cross-entropy

---

## 📚 Part 7: Backpropagation - Learning from Mistakes

**File:** `00-neural-networks/fundamentals/07-backpropagation.ipynb`

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how neural networks learn
- Grasp the chain rule conceptually
- Implement backpropagation from scratch
- See how gradients flow backwards

### Content Structure

#### 1. The Learning Problem

**Current Situation:**
- Network makes predictions
- We measure error (loss)
- But how do we improve?

**Analogy:** "Adjusting a Recipe"
- Made a cake (prediction)
- Too sweet (high loss)
- Which ingredient to change? How much?
- Backpropagation tells us!

#### 2. The Derivative Concept (Gentle)

**What is a Derivative?**
- "If I change input slightly, how does output change?"
- Slope of a curve
- Direction of steepest ascent/descent

**Visual Example:**
```python
# Simple function
def f(x):
    return x**2

# If x=3, f(x)=9
# Derivative at x=3 is 6
# Meaning: if we increase x by 0.1, f increases by ~0.6
```

#### 3. Chain Rule - The Key Insight

**Analogy:** "Domino Effect"
- Change weight → changes neuron → changes next neuron → changes loss
- Chain rule: multiply the effects

**Simple Example:**
```python
# y = f(g(x))
# How does y change with x?
# dy/dx = (dy/dg) * (dg/dx)

def g(x):
    return 2 * x

def f(g):
    return g**2

# x=3 → g=6 → y=36
# dg/dx = 2
# dy/dg = 2*g = 12
# dy/dx = 12 * 2 = 24
```

#### 4. Backpropagation Step by Step

**Layer-by-layer Derivatives:**

```python
class LayerBackprop:
    def __init__(self, n_inputs, n_neurons):
        self.weights = np.random.randn(n_inputs, n_neurons) * 0.1
        self.biases = np.zeros(n_neurons)
        
        # Store for backprop
        self.inputs = None
        self.z = None  # Before activation
        self.output = None  # After activation
    
    def forward(self, inputs):
        """Forward pass - save values needed for backward"""
        self.inputs = inputs
        self.z = np.dot(inputs, self.weights) + self.biases
        self.output = np.maximum(0, self.z)  # ReLU
        return self.output
    
    def backward(self, grad_output):
        """
        Backward pass
        
        grad_output: gradient of loss w.r.t. this layer's output
        returns: gradient w.r.t. this layer's input
        """
        # Gradient through ReLU activation
        grad_z = grad_output.copy()
        grad_z[self.z <= 0] = 0  # ReLU derivative
        
        # Gradient w.r.t. weights
        self.grad_weights = np.dot(self.inputs.T, grad_z)
        
        # Gradient w.r.t. biases
        self.grad_biases = np.sum(grad_z, axis=0)
        
        # Gradient w.r.t. inputs (for previous layer)
        grad_inputs = np.dot(grad_z, self.weights.T)
        
        return grad_inputs
```

#### 5. Complete Backpropagation

```python
class NetworkWithBackprop:
    def __init__(self, layer_sizes):
        self.layers = [LayerBackprop(layer_sizes[i], layer_sizes[i+1]) 
                      for i in range(len(layer_sizes)-1)]
    
    def forward(self, X):
        activation = X
        for layer in self.layers:
            activation = layer.forward(activation)
        return activation
    
    def backward(self, loss_gradient):
        """Backpropagate the gradient"""
        grad = loss_gradient
        for layer in reversed(self.layers):
            grad = layer.backward(grad)
```

#### 6. Gradient Descent Update

```python
def update_weights(self, learning_rate=0.01):
    """Update all weights using computed gradients"""
    for layer in self.layers:
        layer.weights -= learning_rate * layer.grad_weights
        layer.biases -= learning_rate * layer.grad_biases
```

### Code Examples
- Simple derivative calculations
- Manual backpropagation for 2-layer network
- Visualize gradient flow
- Show weight updates

### Visualizations Needed
- Computation graph with gradients
- Gradient flow animation backwards
- Weight update visualization
- Loss decreasing over updates

### Math Explanations
- **Chain Rule:** Step-by-step with simple examples
- **Partial Derivatives:** "Changing one thing at a time"
- **Gradient:** "Direction of steepest increase"

### Common Pitfalls
- "Vanishing gradients" - gradients become very small
- "Exploding gradients" - gradients become very large
- "Why learning rate matters" - too big or too small

## 📚 Part 8: Training Loop - Putting It All Together

**File:** `00-neural-networks/fundamentals/08-training-loop.ipynb`

### Learning Objectives
- Implement complete training process
- Understand epochs, batches, iterations
- Add validation and monitoring
- Implement early stopping

### Content Structure

#### 1. Training Concepts

**Analogy:** "Learning from a Textbook"
- Epoch = reading whole textbook once
- Batch = reading one chapter at a time
- Iteration = each chapter reading session

#### 2. Simple Training Loop

```python
def train_simple(network, X_train, y_train, epochs=10, lr=0.01):
    """Simplest training loop"""
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Forward pass
        predictions = network.forward(X_train)
        
        # Compute loss
        loss = mean_squared_error(predictions, y_train)
        
        # Backward pass
        loss_grad = 2 * (predictions - y_train) / len(y_train)
        network.backward(loss_grad)
        
        # Update weights
        network.update_weights(lr)
        
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss:.4f}")
```

#### 3. Mini-Batch Training

**Why Mini-Batches?**
- Full batch: slow, but stable
- Single example (SGD): fast, but noisy
- Mini-batch: best of both worlds

```python
def train_mini_batch(network, X_train, y_train, 
                     batch_size=32, epochs=10, lr=0.01):
    """Training with mini-batches"""
    n_samples = len(X_train)
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Shuffle data
        indices = np.random.permutation(n_samples)
        X_shuffled = X_train[indices]
        y_shuffled = y_train[indices]
        
        # Process in batches
        for i in range(0, n_samples, batch_size):
            X_batch = X_shuffled[i:i+batch_size]
            y_batch = y_shuffled[i:i+batch_size]
            
            # Forward
            predictions = network.forward(X_batch)
            loss = mean_squared_error(predictions, y_batch)
            
            # Backward
            loss_grad = 2 * (predictions - y_batch) / len(y_batch)
            network.backward(loss_grad)
            
            # Update
            network.update_weights(lr)
```

#### 4. Validation and Monitoring

```python
def train_with_validation(network, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val,
                          batch_size=32, epochs=100, lr=0.01):
    """Training with validation monitoring"""
    
    train_losses = []
    val_losses = []
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Training phase
        epoch_loss = 0
        n_batches = 0
        
        for X_batch, y_batch in get_batches(X_train, y_train, batch_size):
            predictions = network.forward(X_batch)
            loss = mean_squared_error(predictions, y_batch)
            epoch_loss += loss
            n_batches += 1
            
            # Backprop and update
            loss_grad = 2 * (predictions - y_batch) / len(y_batch)
            network.backward(loss_grad)
            network.update_weights(lr)
        
        # Validation phase (no weight updates!)
        val_predictions = network.forward(X_val)
        val_loss = mean_squared_error(val_predictions, y_val)
        
        train_losses.append(epoch_loss / n_batches)
        val_losses.append(val_loss)
        
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Train Loss = {train_losses[-1]:.4f}, "
              f"Val Loss = {val_loss:.4f}")
    
    return train_losses, val_losses
```

#### 5. Early Stopping

```python
class EarlyStopping:
    """Stop training when validation loss stops improving"""
    def __init__(self, patience=5, min_delta=0.001):
        self.patience = patience
        self.min_delta = min_delta
        self.best_loss = float('inf')
        self.counter = 0
        
    def should_stop(self, val_loss):
        if val_loss < self.best_loss - self.min_delta:
            self.best_loss = val_loss
            self.counter = 0
            return False
        else:
            self.counter += 1
            return self.counter >= self.patience
```

#### 6. Complete Training Function

```python
def train_network(network, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val,
                 batch_size=32, epochs=100, lr=0.01,
                 early_stopping=True):
    """Production-ready training loop"""
    
    stopper = EarlyStopping() if early_stopping else None
    history = {'train_loss': [], 'val_loss': []}
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Training
        train_loss = train_epoch(network, X_train, y_train, batch_size, lr)
        
        # Validation
        val_loss = validate(network, X_val, y_val)
        
        # Record
        history['train_loss'].append(train_loss)
        history['val_loss'].append(val_loss)
        
        # Early stopping check
        if stopper and stopper.should_stop(val_loss):
            print(f"Early stopping at epoch {epoch}")
            break
        
        # Progress
        if epoch % 10 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Train={train_loss:.4f}, Val={val_loss:.4f}")
    
    return history
```

### Code Examples
- Train on toy dataset (e.g., XOR problem)
- Visualize training progress
- Show overfitting and how validation catches it
- Demonstrate early stopping

### Visualizations Needed
- Training/validation loss curves
- Learning rate effect
- Batch size comparison
- Overfitting visualization

### Common Pitfalls
- "Overfitting" - great on train, bad on validation
- "Learning rate too high" - loss explodes
- "Learning rate too low" - learns too slowly
- "Batch size matters" - show tradeoffs

## 📚 Part 9: Complete Network from Scratch

**File:** `00-neural-networks/fundamentals/09-complete-network-numpy.ipynb`

### Learning Objectives
- Build a complete neural network using only NumPy
- Train it on real dataset (MNIST)
- Achieve reasonable performance
- Understand every line of code

### Content Structure

#### 1. Complete Implementation

Put everything together in clean classes:

```python
class NeuralNetwork:
    """Complete neural network implementation from scratch"""
    
    def __init__(self, layer_sizes, activations):
        """
        layer_sizes: [input_size, hidden1, hidden2, ..., output_size]
        activations: activation for each layer
        """
        self.layers = []
        for i in range(len(layer_sizes) - 1):
            layer = Layer(
                layer_sizes[i], 
                layer_sizes[i+1],
                activation=activations[i]
            )
            self.layers.append(layer)
    
    def forward(self, X):
        """Forward propagation"""
        activation = X
        for layer in self.layers:
            activation = layer.forward(activation)
        return activation
    
    def backward(self, loss_gradient):
        """Backpropagation"""
        grad = loss_gradient
        for layer in reversed(self.layers):
            grad = layer.backward(grad)
    
    def update_weights(self, learning_rate):
        """Gradient descent update"""
        for layer in self.layers:
            layer.weights -= learning_rate * layer.grad_weights
            layer.biases -= learning_rate * layer.grad_biases
    
    def train(self, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val,
              epochs=50, batch_size=32, learning_rate=0.01):
        """Complete training loop"""
        # Implementation from Part 8
        pass
```

#### 2. MNIST Classification Example

```python
# Load MNIST
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
X, y = load_digits(return_X_y=True)

# Preprocess
X = X / 16.0  # Normalize
y_onehot = one_hot_encode(y)

# Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(...)

# Create network
network = NeuralNetwork(
    layer_sizes=[64, 128, 64, 10],
    activations=['relu', 'relu', 'softmax']
)

# Train
history = network.train(
    X_train, y_train,
    X_val, y_val,
    epochs=50,
    batch_size=32,
    learning_rate=0.01
)

# Evaluate
accuracy = evaluate(network, X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}")
```

#### 3. Visualizing Results

- Training curves
- Confusion matrix
- Misclassified examples
- Learned weights visualization

### Code Examples
- Complete, documented implementation
- MNIST training
- Result visualization
- Hyperparameter tuning

### Visualizations Needed

- Weight visualizations

### Common Pitfalls
- "Why is accuracy low?" - need more epochs/better architecture
- "Validation accuracy plateauing" - might need regularization
- "Loss is NaN" - learning rate too high or numerical instability

## 📚 Part 10: PyTorch Equivalent

**File:** `00-neural-networks/fundamentals/10-pytorch-equivalent.ipynb`

### Learning Objectives
- Translate NumPy implementation to PyTorch
- Understand PyTorch's automatic differentiation
- See how much simpler it is with a framework
- Learn PyTorch best practices

### Content Structure

#### 1. Why PyTorch?

**What We Did Manually:**
- Forward propagation ✓
- Backpropagation (calculated derivatives) ✓
- Weight updates ✓
- Loss functions ✓

**What PyTorch Does Automatically:**
- Automatic differentiation (autograd)
- GPU acceleration
- Optimized operations
- Built-in layers and functions

#### 2. PyTorch Basics

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Creating tensors
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Automatic differentiation
x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x**2
y.backward()
print(x.grad)  # dy/dx = 2x = 4.0
```

#### 3. Building the Same Network

```python
class PyTorchNetwork(nn.Module):
    """Same network as our NumPy version"""
    
    def __init__(self, layer_sizes):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Create layers
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Linear(layer_sizes[i], layer_sizes[i+1])
            for i in range(len(layer_sizes) - 1)
        ])
        
        # Activation
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    
    def forward(self, x):
        """Forward pass - PyTorch handles backward automatically!"""
        for layer in self.layers[:-1]:
            x = self.relu(layer(x))
        x = self.layers[-1](x)  # No activation on output
        return x

# Create network
model = PyTorchNetwork([64, 128, 64, 10])
```

#### 4. Training Loop in PyTorch

```python
# Loss function
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Optimizer (handles weight updates)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for X_batch, y_batch in dataloader:
        # Forward
        predictions = model(X_batch)
        loss = criterion(predictions, y_batch)
        
        # Backward
        optimizer.zero_grad()  # Clear old gradients
        loss.backward()        # Automatic backpropagation!
        optimizer.step()       # Update weights
```

#### 5. Side-by-Side Comparison

Show the same task:
- NumPy version (manual)
- PyTorch version (automatic)

Highlight how PyTorch:
- Automatically computes gradients
- Provides optimized implementations
- Handles GPU acceleration
- Simplifies the code

### Code Examples
- Recreate all previous examples in PyTorch
- Show torch.autograd in action
- Train on MNIST
- Compare results with NumPy version

### Visualizations Needed
- Computation graph visualization
- Side-by-side code comparison
- Performance comparison (speed)

### Common Pitfalls
- "requires_grad" - when to use
- "zero_grad()" - why necessary
- "model.eval()" vs "model.train()" - batch norm, dropout
- Moving between CPU and GPU
