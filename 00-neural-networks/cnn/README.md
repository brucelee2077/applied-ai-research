# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks are specialized neural networks designed for processing grid-like data, particularly images. This section covers CNN architectures, their components, and applications.

## Key Concepts

### Convolution Operation
- 2D convolution fundamentals
- Filters/kernels and feature maps
- Stride and padding
- Receptive fields
- Parameter sharing
- Translation invariance

### CNN Layers
- Convolutional layers
- Pooling layers (max, average)
- Fully connected layers
- Global average pooling
- 1x1 convolutions

### Architectural Patterns
- **LeNet-5** (1998) - First successful CNN
- **AlexNet** (2012) - Deep learning revolution
- **VGGNet** (2014) - Depth matters
- **GoogLeNet/Inception** (2014) - Efficient architectures
- **ResNet** (2015) - Skip connections
- **DenseNet** (2017) - Dense connections
- **EfficientNet** (2019) - Compound scaling

### Modern Techniques
- Batch normalization
- Residual connections
- Skip connections
- Depthwise separable convolutions
- Squeeze-and-excitation blocks
- Attention mechanisms in CNNs

### Applications
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Semantic segmentation
- Style transfer
- Image generation
- Feature extraction for multimodal models
