# Neural Network Implementations

## Overview

This directory contains code implementations of neural network concepts covered in this section. Implementations range from from-scratch NumPy versions to production-ready PyTorch/TensorFlow implementations.

## Structure

### From Scratch
Implementations using only NumPy to understand the fundamentals:
- Feedforward neural networks
- Backpropagation algorithm
- Various activation functions
- Basic optimizers (SGD, momentum)
- Simple CNN operations
- Basic RNN cells

### Framework-Based
Production-ready implementations using PyTorch/TensorFlow:
- Complete MLP architectures
- CNN models (LeNet, ResNet, etc.)
- LSTM and GRU implementations
- Training loops and utilities
- Model evaluation code

### Training Scripts
Ready-to-use training scripts for:
- MNIST digit classification
- CIFAR-10 image classification
- IMDB sentiment analysis
- Custom dataset training

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

### Running Examples
```bash
# From-scratch neural network
python numpy_nn.py

# PyTorch CNN on MNIST
python pytorch_cnn_mnist.py

# LSTM text classification
python lstm_text_classifier.py
```
