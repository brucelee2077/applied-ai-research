# Neural Networks Fundamentals

## Overview

This section covers the core concepts of feedforward neural networks, providing the mathematical and computational foundations for all deep learning architectures.

## Key Concepts

### Network Architecture
- Perceptrons and linear models
- Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)
- Hidden layers and representations
- Network depth vs. width
- Universal approximation theorem

### Activation Functions
- Sigmoid and tanh (historical perspective)
- ReLU and its variants (Leaky ReLU, PReLU, ELU)
- GELU (used in transformers)
- Swish/SiLU
- When to use which activation

### Forward Propagation
- Matrix operations and vectorization
- Layer-wise computation
- Batch processing
- Computational efficiency

### Backpropagation
- Chain rule and automatic differentiation
- Gradient computation
- Weight updates
- Common pitfalls

### Optimization
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Momentum-based methods
- Adam and AdamW
- Learning rate schedules
- Gradient clipping

### Regularization
- L1 and L2 regularization
- Dropout
