    "\n",
    "### 1. **The Neuron Formula**\n",
    "```\n",
    "output = (x₁ × w₁) + (x₂ × w₂) + ... + (xₙ × wₙ) + bias\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Multiply each input by its weight\n",
    "- Add them all together\n",
    "- Add the bias\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Components**\n",
    "- **Inputs (x)**: The data we're processing\n",
    "- **Weights (w)**: How important each input is (learned during training)\n",
    "- **Bias (b)**: Baseline adjustment (also learned)\n",
    "- **Output**: The neuron's prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **What Weights Do**\n",
    "- **Positive weight**: Input contributes positively to output\n",
    "- **Negative weight**: Input contributes negatively\n",
    "- **Large absolute value**: Input is very important\n",
    "- **Small absolute value**: Input matters less\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **What Bias Does**\n",
    "- Shifts the decision boundary\n",
    "- Allows flexibility in where the boundary is placed\n",
    "- Think of it as a \"default opinion\" before seeing data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Limitations**\n",
    "- Single neuron = linear decision boundary only\n",
    "- Can't solve problems like XOR\n",
    "- Need multiple neurons for complex patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Implementation**\n",
    "- Can use loops (clear but slow)\n",
    "- Should use NumPy dot product (fast and efficient)\n",
    "- Same math, different implementation"
