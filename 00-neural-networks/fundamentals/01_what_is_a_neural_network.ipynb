    "1. Light enters your eyes\n",
    "2. That light becomes electrical signals in neurons\n",
    "3. These neurons pass signals to other neurons\n",
    "4. Your brain recognizes the letters and words\n",
    "5. You understand the meaning!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your brain has about **86 billion neurons** all working together. Each neuron:\n",
    "- Receives signals from other neurons\n",
    "- Processes these signals\n",
    "- Decides whether to \"fire\" and send a signal to the next neurons\n",

    "**Artificial neural networks** are inspired by your brain, but they're much simpler. Instead of biological neurons, we use:\n",

    "- **Numbers** (weights and inputs)\n",
    "- **Computer programs** (Python code!)\n",

    "## 🔧 The Basic Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down what makes up a neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. 🔵 Neurons (The Building Blocks)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a neuron?**\n",
    "A neuron is simply a mathematical function that:\n",
    "1. Takes some numbers as input\n",
    "2. Multiplies each input by a weight\n",
    "3. Adds them all up\n",
    "4. Applies a simple function (like \"keep positive values, make negatives zero\")\n",
    "5. Outputs a single number\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Think of a neuron as a **voter** who:\n",
    "- Listens to multiple opinions (inputs)\n",
    "- Trusts some friends more than others (weights)\n",
    "- Makes a weighted decision (output)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. ⚖️ Weights (The Importance Values)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are weights?**\n",
    "Each connection between neurons has a **weight** - just a number that says how important that connection is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example - Deciding to Watch a Movie:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Inputs:\n",
    "- Friends' recommendation: +5\n",
    "- IMDB rating: +8\n",
    "- Your mood: +3\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights (how much you trust each):\n",
    "- Friends: 0.7 (you trust them a lot)\n",
    "- IMDB: 0.5 (somewhat reliable)\n",
    "- Mood: 0.2 (not as important)\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision = (5 × 0.7) + (8 × 0.5) + (3 × 0.2) = 8.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the decision score is high enough, you watch the movie!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. 🏗️ Layers (Organized Groups)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a layer?**\n",
    "A layer is just a group of neurons that work in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of layers:**\n",
    "- **Input layer:** Receives the raw data\n",
    "- **Hidden layers:** Do the processing (can have many!)\n",
    "- **Output layer:** Produces the final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**More layers = \"Deeper\" network = More complex patterns it can learn**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. ⚡ Activation Functions (The Decision Makers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is an activation function?**\n",
    "After a neuron adds up all its weighted inputs, it applies an **activation function** - a simple rule like:\n",
    "- \"If the total is negative, output 0\"\n",
    "- \"If the total is positive, keep it as is\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need them?**\n",
    "Without activation functions, the entire network would just be one big multiplication and addition - it couldn't learn complex patterns!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Think of activation as a **filter or decision threshold**\n",
    "- Like a bouncer at a club: \"You need to be *this* tall to ride\"\n",
    "- Or a thermostat: \"Only turn on heating if temperature is below 65°F\"\n",
    "\n",

    "**Step 1: Random Start**\n",
    "```\n",
    "When a network is born, all weights are random numbers.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Make a Prediction**\n",

    "Show it an example: \"Here's a picture\"\n",
    "Network guesses: \"I think it's a cat\" (but it's actually a dog)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Calculate Error**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Compare the guess to the truth: \"You're wrong! It was a dog.\"\n",
    "Measure how wrong: \"You were 80% confident it was a cat. That's pretty wrong!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Adjust Weights**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Change the weights slightly to make a better guess next time.\n",
    "This is called 'backpropagation' - we'll learn it in detail later!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Repeat**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Do this thousands or millions of times with different examples.\n",
    "Gradually, the network gets better and better!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Training = Finding the Right Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the big secret! **Training a neural network means finding the best values for all the weights.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy - Learning to Bake:**\n",
    "1. **First attempt:** You randomly mix ingredients (random weights)\n",
    "2. **Taste test:** The cake is too sweet (prediction vs reality)\n",
    "3. **Adjust recipe:** Use less sugar next time (adjust weights)\n",
    "4. **Repeat:** Keep trying until you get it perfect!\n",
